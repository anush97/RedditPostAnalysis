16,For those of you wondering why you aren’t hearing about Ukrainian counter offensives right now…that’s not how this is going to work. This isn’t going to wrap up in a handful of hours,16294,t05ged,https://www.reddit.com/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/t05ged/for_those_of_you_wondering_why_you_arent_hearing/,1420,1645689360.0,"You need to understand that literally no expert has ever suggested that Ukraine would be able to hold off the initial Russian advance, and most don’t think that that they’ll be able to hold out long term. 

So what is happening?

We had a bunch of first strikes from stand-off weapons like ballistic and cruise missiles targeting known military bases, fixed installations, munitions depots / factories, airfields, and command and control (shit you can’t easily move). Ukraine knew they would happen, and Russia knew that too but they had to do it to make sure. No one expected resistance to prevent what happened in the last few hours. 

Next we’ve seen Russian forces moving into Ukraine on the ground. Again, no one thought Ukraine could prevent this. 

So what’s next?

Russia started this at a time of their choosing. Assuming that they haven’t just fallen to pieces, Ukraine is likely now offering token resistance to slow advances but not tipping their hand to show all their cards. They are likely sitting back in the observe, orient, decide, act loop to keep tabs on where the Russians are advancing, how far supply lines are being stretched, and organizing the disposition of Ukrainian forces to respond at a time and place of their choosing. 

For the Russians to achieve their goals they have to move towards some pretty obvious objectives, that limits the degrees of freedom in their actions. Ukraine can’t win in a straight up fight, so they’ll be concentrating forces (with intel from western countries) on the weakest parts of the advances to make this as costly as possible for Russia. Ukraine has more options the more spread out that Russian forces get. 

Everything about this next phase is going to be shitty for literally everyone involved…people need to not be expecting minute by minute information that is in anyway meaningful to understanding what is happening on the ground, or what any bit of news means for the larger picture. Lots of it is going to be disinformation, or images / video that’s hours old falsely attached to some new headline. 

Unless the Ukrainian government collapses in the next day we won’t actually know how things are shaping up for a couple days. Remember how before the Russians invaded every day had all sorts of new narratives that didn’t go anywhere until suddenly they did? It’s going to be just like that except people will be dying needlessly. 

I’m just saying this in the hopes that at least a couple people who aren’t in direct danger will stop doomscrolling and obsessively refreshing - this is some of the most fucked up shit that has happened in a long time in the west, but you don’t need to give yourself anxiety if you haven’t checked in on things in the last 4min.",2022-02-24 02:56:00

Everybody talks about how Putin denied the sovereignty of Ukraine, but nobody talks about how he doesn't even consider this war to be the war against Ukraine. In his mind it's the war of Russia against US and NATO allies, where the West uses Ukraine as a proxy. It's what he clearly stated in his speech.

Putin has been waging hybrid war on the US and EU for many years now, and for him the invasion of Ukraine is only another step in this larger campaign.

The list of hostile actions he has done in this campaign against the West so far includes:

* Meddling in US and EU elections.
* Cyberattacks and cyberterrorism against US and EU
* Stocking division in the West by supporting radical nationalists and conspiracy theorists. This is a part of an old KGB playbook, btw: if you want to dismantle democracy, support radical nationalistic movements.
* Conducting political murders and terrorist acts on EU and British soil.
* Waging an extremely successful military campaign in Syria, keeping Assad in power.
* Using fossil fuel as a tool for blackmail and coercion in Europe, intentionally driving prices up to get his way.
* Crushing the democratic protest movement in Belarus, keeping Lukashenko in power, de facto annexing Belarus. This is something that the West virtually ignored.
* Triggering migrant crisis on the Polish-Belarussian border.
* Crushing the rebellion in Kazakhstan, keeping Tokayev in power. Political situation in Kazakhstan was pretty complex, and again, this was completely ignored in the West.
* Waging war in Georgia, which ultimately led to dismantling of pro-Western democratic government of Saakashvili. Current government in Georgia is arguably pro-Russian, part of the Georgian territory was recognized by Russia as independent.

Putin again and again has crushed pro-democratic movements and protests around the world and has meddled in the West's affairs trying to weaken it politically and stock division. For him this is all part of one big revanchist military campaign where he takes revenge on the West for loosing the Cold War and rebuilds Soviet Union in the process. After he's done with Ukraine, he will move to other countries: Moldova, the Baltics, maybe even Poland.

It feels like nobody in the West sees Russian actions as systemic. Nobody in US and EU recognizes the war that is being waged against them. Even now everybody is discussing whether the recognition of DPR and LPR by Russia constitutes an invasion or not, instead of actually fighting back and sanctioning Russia. 

I thought that the way he openly admitted to all of this would be a wake up call, but I guess not.",2022-02-22 08:29:19

How to defeat Putin?

Many recognise the importance of coercive measures against Russia and necessity to give it a way out

And yet, some presume that the way out should be given to Putin to force him to negotiate. That's a disastrous idea. There's no way he can roll back now🧵

I find it morally reprehensible that the West has been so reactive and not working to proactively prevent what is clearly becoming a genocide.

I am tired of hearing that we need to have tiered responses that are commensurate with Russia's atrocities, as if all the war crimes so far aren't enough.

1260,Comment,1,i0j8i0x,,0,1647203744.0,"It's not. The lack of protest when it all unfolded, plus interviews from international media clearly show that Putin had a lot of support there. Literally everything indicates it and not a single expert disagrees with it. While it's not possible to put an exact % on it, evidence absolutely does suggest Putin had a lot of support in Crimea.

Before all the events, there had already been polls around Ukraine in relation to Putin's popularity. Also that one clearly showed high support for Putin in that Region (don't remember the exact numbers). Also if we look at the % of Russian speakers, Crimea is somewhere at the top.

You just want to doubt it, while there's nothing supporting the suggestion that a significant number of Crimeans were against it.

Today things might be different though, because life got more expensive under Putin as well as water shortages. Plus the war, could mean that support for Putin/Russia might have decreased.",2022-03-13 16:35:44

And NATO needs to make that very clear by not allowing it this time.    


Launching nukes because he made a mistake in Ukraine is playing his last and only card.  Again --- not a smart move for such a small reward.  Not to mention he'd been done for when if he pulls out of Ukraine he's still the wealthiest guy on the planet and still likely in charge of Russia etc.  Launching nukes ends that and ends his daughters and his grandkids as well.

Companies lease planes, trucks, cars, etc. because like every company and individual they have an upper limit on their credit and leasing is done outside of that. Airlines would not be able to raise the money to buy the planes normally; they especially are not going to be able to do so when they are severely limited as to where they can fly, when their currency is crashing, and when sanctions are in place. No one is going to loan them the money to buy planes.

And again, it doesn't matter if they keep flying them; they are flying some of them domestically. Planes are only insurable and certifiable to enter other countries airspace if the meticulous maintenance they require is done. Without parts that goes out the window.

I think the best comment I've heard about this whole shamozzle comes from Lazerpig, of all the bloody places, and it's basically ""I don't know what the fuck is going on, and neither (to a point) *do you*.""

He's right, and I'm not going to get to any sort of truth aside from ""Russia invaded"" so I just don't bother anymore.  I can track the progress of the war, though, because above anything else, Russian military competence is (unexpectedly for me) on serious trial here, and the next few weeks will determine whether or not they actually have any.

1357,Comment,0,i0j7ifc,,0,1647203318.0,"NATO has conventional superiority up until the point that tactical nukes significantly degrade that combat power.

Sorry, but there is zero to suggest that the US and NATO would begin slinging ICBMs at Russian cities in response to tactical strikes. This shouldn't be new information or a controversial statement. You can read about 70s and 80s era military planning on both sides to see what the thinking then was - in large part nothing has changed since then. The Soviet Seven Days to the River Rhine planning exercise, for example, envisioned a 7-day nuclear war with Russian tactical nuclear strikes on West Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, northern Italy, Austria (not a NATO member oddly enough), Denmark and NATO tactical strikes on Poland, Czech Republic, East Germany, and Hungary. They did not expect the conflict to escalate to strategic strikes so long as they didn't utilize strategic weapons against France, the UK, amd the US - as such they directed only conventional strikes against the UK and France, and no strikes against the US mainland whatsoever out of concern of escalating hostilities. Likewise what is known about the various Able Archer exercises indicates that American and NATO planners likewise foresaw escalation of hostilities to the point of the exchange of tactical and intermediate-range ""sub-strategic"" weapons in response to tactical chemical, biological, or nuclear strikes, but generally not strategic retaliation.

Even the most recent known US SIOP/OPLAN/CONPLANs allowed for limited tactical nuclear exchanges in the event of a Russian tactical nuclear strike. The idea that a tac. strike would automatically result in the US/NATO using strategic nukes in response is pure fiction - particularly when the US own SIOP/OPLAN/CONPLAN is built around ""flexible use"" and has been since the Kennedy administration, which allows for ""deliberate escalation"" to limited nuclear war using tactical warheads as a counter-response to tactical nuclear strikes against US/allied forces or massive conventional losses. Escalation to ""General Nuclear Response"" is limited to existential threat or retaliation-in-kind.

FYI - I work with a guy who was one of the senior experts and negotiators on INF, START I, START II, SORT, CTBT, and New START, as well as being a (now retired) USAF nuclear missile officer. We have discussed at length the differing philosophies, doctrines and interpretations of how these weapons are handled and utilized.

The aircraft will be re-registered within Russia and will fly to nowhere but Russia-friendly states - which was already a done deal.

Here's an article on this from five days ago, before Bermuda's action:

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-08/owners-outfoxed-as-russia-absconds-with-10-billion-of-jets](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-08/owners-outfoxed-as-russia-absconds-with-10-billion-of-jets)

You can see that Russian confiscation of the aircraft was already a thing. Russia will re-register the aircraft domestically and keep flying them only to places where they are safe from repossession.

Yeah, it's kind of mind boggling that Russia has just effectively stolen $10bn worth of commercial aircraft.

But I'm not terribly sympathetic to the lessors. They chose to lease into a state run by Putin, and it's been clear for decades that Putin is a stone cold thug. Sure, Russia signed the Capetown Agreement, that says it will cooperate with lessors trying to recover aircraft from Russian carriers. And Putin simply ignore that.

I wonder if someone who has no compunction at all about killing his opponents, including on foreign soil in the most horrible of ways, might be more likely to ignore international agreements when it suits him? Do ya think?

We are not discussing bioweapons. We are discussing dangerous material from bio labs that could make its way into enemy hands. We do not know what the dangerous material is. These are facts.

No need to wait if you have the ability to think critically and if you have even just a little bit of foresight.

>At a minimum, I am seeing a strip going from Moldova to Donbas being Russian, no Ukrainian access to the Black Sea. And I think the Germans will be happy to take that provided the gas doesn't stop.

Europe has long ago learned their lessons with Russia/the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany from the past. Europe doesn’t need Russia for oil or gas either when there are alternative sources around the world that can arrive by ship.

>America will keep up sanctions but Europe will wind back some and get around trade restrictions going through intermediary countries like Serbia.

There’s no need to import anything from Russia or to export anything to Russia. They will be treated just as the world treated the isolated Soviet Union.

>China and Russia will get closer and China will help their economy stabilise.

China will take advantage of Russia and control Russia more and more now that Russia is severely weakened and its economy is completely collapsing.

>Oh and Ukraine will never get into NATO or EU because everyone else will be afraid that Ukraine will start a war to get back conceded territory.

Ukraine is already in the process of joining the EU. When Russia gets tired of having tens of thousands and eventually hundreds of thousands of soldiers die as the weeks and months go by they will eventually leave defeated just like they left Afghanistan in the late 80’s after getting their teeth kicked in by the Mujahideen. Then Ukraine will join NATO and all of the Russian wealth that has been seized around the world, including Russia’s foreign reserves, will be used for rebuilding and re-arming Ukraine. The future is very bright and very incredible for Ukraine. Ukraine will have a very powerful economy similar to Germany in the years ahead. The Ukrainian military will be extremely powerful as well.",2022-03-13 16:07:05

Iraq was working on WMDs chemical, biological, and nuclear ( the west had zero evidence to back this up and long since been regarded as false) so it was up to the west to keep the world safe.

In actual fact we where dropping cluster bombs , commiting war crimes, using phosphorus on civilian populations, mistreating prisoners all on the name of the special operation ""Iraqi freedom""....

Back then people where drinking it up like Kool-Aid and ... Still believe it wasn't about oil to this day.

That said, an admittedly cursory review does not show me that the Ukrainian MOD posted it initially.  The Defense of Ukraine twitter account definitely has it posted - still - which is not smart..but I cannot find evidence that shows me that they originally manufactured it.  Best I can find are references on gaming blogs to it appearing on someone's Facebook page, but not whose, so...  It's also worth noting that dedicated military analysts were taken in by that footage.  That the UA was as well is possible.  That they still have it up suggests they are taking advantage of someone else's propaganda work.

So I suppose we are talking about the difference between manufacturing propaganda, and taking advantage of it.  It's up to you to decide if one is worse than the other.  I personally don't much know and, tbh, I'm not sure I care if one is worse or not.",2022-03-13 16:03:21

> Sullivan told CNN the United States believed China was aware that Russia was planning some action in Ukraine before the invasion took place, although Beijing may not have understood the full extent of what was planned.

> The United States and its allies have imposed sweeping, unprecedented sanctions against Russia and banned its energy imports, while providing billions of dollars of military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine.

Suposedly this sort of survailance missle is usually used by ukraine , but might be a false flag attack by Belarus or Russia , the black box will soon tell the truth , we hope.

If it was an accident by Ukraine i think everybody will forgive it tho.

But still , it revealed that a missle CAN cross halfway over Europe undetected and hit a NATO country without anyone stopping it.

Soliders need to be fed, paid, dressed and healed
Vehicels need to be replaced, repaired and maintained
Guns need to their ammo restocked and replaced

Any of the above requires the goverment to buy good or services from its civilian sectors, or use stored goods.
For example a weapons factory cant produce weapons for free, it need to buy materials and pay wages.

If even a single one of the goods above cant be afforded by the country, like a house of cards, everything will come crashing down together.",2022-03-13 15:56:37
