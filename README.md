## Introduction

Reddit is a social news aggregation website where users can submit and discuss content on a wide variety of topics. This repository contains scripts for collecting data from Reddit posts and analyzing the data to gain insights into user behavior and content trends.

## Installation

To use the Reddit Post Analysis scripts, you will need to install the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- PRAW
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using the following command:
"pip install praw numpy pandas matplotlib"


## Usage

To use the Reddit Post Analysis scripts, you will need to obtain a Reddit API key and configure the `praw.ini` file with your credentials. You can follow the instructions in the `praw.ini.template` file to do this.

Once you have configured your credentials, you can run the scripts using the following command:

"python <script-name>.py"


Replace `<script-name>` with the name of the script you want to run (e.g., `collect_data.py`, `analyze_data.py`, `visualize_data.py`).

## Data Collection

The `collect_data.py` script can be used to collect data from Reddit posts. You will need to provide the name of a subreddit and the number of posts to collect. The script will save the data to a CSV file.

## Analysis

The `analyze_data.py` script can be used to analyze the data collected by the `collect_data.py` script. The script contains functions for calculating various statistics and insights from the data, such as the most popular posts, the most active users, and the most common words used in post titles and comments.

## Visualization

The `visualize_data.py` script can be used to create visualizations of the data collected by the `collect_data.py` script. The script contains functions for creating bar charts, word clouds, and other types of visualizations.
